# UIPredicateEditor

**UIPredicateEditor** aims to be come a drop-in replacement of `NSPredicateEditor` for iOS, iPadOS and Mac Catalyst targets.

The plan is to have a 1:1 API implementation so implementing it in cross-platform projects and SwiftUI apps is seamless and requires to be setup only once.

**⚠️ WARNING**: This is a pre-release component, and as such should not be used in production software yet. The public API is bound to change.
